# Show me my money
The purpose of this [OctoberCMS](http://octobercms.com) plugin is to offer the ability to manage portfolios containing assets. Those assets can be identified as stocks, bonds or a mix of both.

## This is BETA software
This plugin is under development. There are a lot of glitches, elements I wish to add or improvements to be made.

I'm not a professional developer. This plugin is my first published work. Which means it's certainly full of issues, inconsistencies or unrespected conventions.

It is primarily meant for my personal usage (both as a tool and as a learning experience.) Since it may be useful for other people, I decided to publish it.

Which means:
* You use this at your own risk
* Any feedback is appreciated!
* I do know I'm bad at this, so feedback is really appreciated
