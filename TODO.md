* Assets pages
    * Display portfolios containing those assets

* Movements
    * Additional fields: count in entry / exit of the portfolio, count in the initial value (will be useful for graphs)

* Portfolios
    * Add the valuation of currently held stocks (beware of dates)
    * Display the expected capital gain / loss (based on the current valuation)
    * Display the realized capital gain / loss (based on the valuation at time of buy & sell)
    * Display the sum of deposits + the gain / loss
    * Identify account as "Regular deposits" (will be displayed differently)

* Graphs
    * This is the thing I'll work on last (too many variables now...)
    * Display portfolio's value over time
    * Include ability to compare portfolios (with common reference point)
    * Display graphs for "regular deposit" accounts
